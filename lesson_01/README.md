# Lesson 01

Welcome to the first seminar in the Nena Python course where we will introduce several tools that we will be using throughout the course.

## Windows Terminal

The Windows Terminal is Windows new terminal application which you can use to control most things in the Windows operating system.
We will use windows terminal to:

1) Navigate the file system
2) Run python scripts 
3) Monitor the progress of python programs.
4) Use simple command-line programs build in python. 
5) Start other programs such as JupyterLab, VSCode, or just about any program installed on your machine.

To navigate the Windows Terminal we use a set of commands. We will go over these in the course.
For future reference, [here is a good short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpRGRLI8Fy8) covering the commands we have covered.

## Github Desktop

Github Desktop is the tool we use to share our notebooks and scripts. It uploads your scripts to your GitHub page where
other people can 

## JupyterLab

JupyterLab is a great tool for doing anything data analysis. With it, you create what is referred to as notebooks. You can use them to visualize data, work with excel files, run python scripts and write python code wich runs directly in the notebook, you can even write complete publishable books with JupyterLab.

An important part of using JupyterLab is to know how to document your code. To do that, you can use the MarkDown text language to write formatted text, much like a Word document.

## VS Code

VS Code is one of the de-facto code editors used today. It is a free, open-source program maintained by Microsoft. VS Code supports many
programming languages and has excellent debugging tools. 

## When to use what?

- The Windows terminal is used to navigate your file system and launch JupyterLab and VS Code in the right folders. It is usually the first application
  you open when you want to view a Notebook or python code.

- JupyterLab is your go-to data analysis tools.

- VS Code is a great code editor and is used to view large code files and run large programs. You will typically use it
  to edit scripts.
  
  
# Homework  
  
## Assignment: Create a github repository and share a jupyter notebook.

You will need to create a Github repository using Github Desktop. In here you will
create a jupyter notebook in which you are tasked to:

1) Write 3 types of headers.
2) Write a mathematical expression or equation (tip: use MS Words equation editor and convert the equation to LaTex and copy pase into your notebook).
3) Write a bullet list.
4) Include a hyper-link to a website.
5) Include a picture, either from another webpage or from a local file.

To practice markdown you will for homework also be going through the MarkDown tutorial which you can
find in JupyterLab by going to: 

Help>Markdown Reference

You will run this tutorial directly from within JupyterLab.
