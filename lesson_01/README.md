# Lesson 01

Welcome to the first seminar in the Nena Python course where we will introduce several tools that we will be using throughout the course.

## Windows Terminal

The Windows Terminal is Windows new terminal application which you can use to control most things in the Windows operating system.
We will use windows terminal to:

1) Navigate the file system
2) Run python scripts 
3) Monitor the progress of python programs.
4) Use simple command-line programs build in python. 
5) Start other programs such as JupyterLab, VSCode, or just about any program installed on your machine.

To navigate the Windows Terminal we use a set of commands. We will go over these in the course.
For future reference, [here is a good short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpRGRLI8Fy8) covering the commands we have covered.
