## Usefull preparation

I advise you to lsiten to the following podcast which talks about how you can use Python with Excel.
  * [Escaping Excel hell with Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/200/escaping-excel-hell-with-python-and-pandas)
  * [10 tips to move from Excel to Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/288/10-tips-to-move-from-excel-to-python)
 
Think about what you want to get from this course. Think specifically on how Python could help you in your day-to-day tasks.
